| Revenue Source | Pros | Cons | Key Consideration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Property Tax** | Immobile base; Promotes accountability; Stable yield. | Technically difficult to assess; Politically unpopular; Can be regressive if poorly administered. | Requires strong and transparent administrative capacity for property valuation, registration, and collection. |
| **Business Licenses/Fees** | Relatively easy to administer; Can be linked to local services consumed by businesses. | Revenue potential may be limited; Can be arbitrary and discourage local economic activity if not well-designed. | Fee structure must be predictable, transparent, and non-punitive to foster a good business climate. |
| **User Charges**<br>*(e.g., for water, waste collection)* | Links payment to consumption (efficient); Recovers costs for service provision. | Can be inequitable, harming poor users' access to essential services. | Requires carefully designed subsidies or lifeline tariffs to protect access for the poor. |
| **Surcharges on National Tax**<br>*(e.g., personal income)* | Easy to administer ("piggybacking"); Revenue can grow with the economy; Broad base. | Can reduce local autonomy and accountability if rates are not locally set; Can exacerbate regional inequalities. | The degree of local discretion over setting the surcharge rate is the critical determinant of its value for decentralization. |
